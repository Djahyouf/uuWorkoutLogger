# uuWorkoutLogger - Student Project

> Application uuWorkoutLogger is a comprehensive workout logging and progress tracking application designed to help users monitor their fitness journey efficiently.

## Task Description

Rather than developing a generic workout logger, the focus is on creating a specialized tool catering to specific fitness disciplines, such as bodybuilding, street workout, or calisthenics. Each workout session includes various exercises targeting specific muscle groups. The application should support customization of exercise details, such as sets, reps, and weights, and be capable of adjusting these parameters based on user-defined "portions" or variations in workout intensity.
